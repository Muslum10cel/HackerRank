/**
 *
 * Definition of Problem :
 *
 * Calvin is driving his favorite vehicle on the 101 freeway. He notices that
 * the check engine light of his vehicle is on, and he wants to service it
 * immediately to avoid any risks. Luckily, a service lane runs parallel to the
 * highway. The length of the service lane is N units. The service lane
 * consists of N segments of equal length and different width.
 *
 * Calvin can enter to and exit from any segment. Let's call the entry segment
 * as index i and the exit segment as index j. Assume that the exit segment
 * lies after the entry segment (i<=j) and 0â‰¤i. Calvin has to pass through
 * all segments from index i to index j (both inclusive).
 *
 *
 * Calvin has three types of vehicles - bike, car, and truck - represented by
 * 1, 2 and 3, respectively. These numbers also denote the width of the
 * vehicle.
 *
 * You are given an array width of length N, where width[k] represents
 * the width of the kth segment of the service lane. It is guaranteed that while
 * servicing he can pass through at most 1000 segments, including the entry
 * and exit segments.
 *
 * If width[k]=1, only the bike can pass through the kth segment.
 * If width[k]=2, the bike and the car can pass through the kth segment.
 * If width[k]=3, all three vehicles can pass through the kth segment.
 * 
 * 
 * Given the entry and exit point of Calvin's vehicle in the service lane,
 * output the type of the largest vehicle which can pass through the service
 * lane (including the entry and exit segments).
