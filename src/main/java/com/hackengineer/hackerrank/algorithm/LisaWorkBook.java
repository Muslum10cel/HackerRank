/**
 *
 * Problem Definition :
 *
 * Lisa just got a new math workbook. A workbook contains exercise problems,
 * grouped into chapters.
 *
 *
 * There are n chapters in Lisa's workbook, numbered from 1 to n.
 *
 * The i-th chapter has ti problems, numbered from 1 to ti. Each page can hold
 * up to k problems.
 *
 * There are no empty pages or unnecessary spaces, so only the last page of a
 * chapter may contain fewer than k problems.
 *
 * Each new chapter starts on a new page, so a page will never contain problems
 * from more than one chapter.
 *
 * The page number indexing starts at 1.
 *
 *
 * Lisa believes a problem to be special if its index (within a chapter) is the
 * same as the page number where it's located. Given the details for Lisa's
 * workbook, can you count its number of special problems?
