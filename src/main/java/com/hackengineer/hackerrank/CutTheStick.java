/**
 * 
 * Definition of Problem :
 * 
 * You are given N sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive
 * integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are
 * reduced by the length of the smallest stick.
 *
 * Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths: 5 4 4 2 2 8
 *
 * Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six
 * sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length),
 * whose lengths are the following: 3 2 2 6
 *
 * The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.
 *
 * Given the length of N sticks, print the number of sticks that are left
 * before each subsequent cut operations.
 *
 * Note: For each cut operation, you have to recalculate the length of smallest
 * sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).
